# odin_recipes

In this project I will build a basic recipe website.
This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

After learning CSS Basics I will come back and make it visually prettier.

After completing this project, I hope to master html and create websitees with it. I want to be fluent in crating the boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, using attribute correctly, creating links and inserting images and also learn how to use git and write good commit messages.
